# Overview

For this project, I wanted to practice using object oriented programming in Python. I have only done it in other languages so far.

In my church, I am a secretary who sets up meetings between one of our leaders and the men of our congregation to see if they have been reaching out to the people they are assigned to "minister" to and how it is going. This program is designed to be my calendar and keep everything I need to know in one place. It will keep track of all of the meetings and the current status of all of the people I am over.

I used ChatGPT to help me learn any new syntax needed build my program. Any code that I got from ChatGPT is labeled with comments in the program itself.

# Future Work

- Simplify the meeting scheduling process. I would give menu options for dates instead of making the user type it in by hand.
- Fix the display companionships feature so that it only displays each name one time instead of once for each member of the companionship.
- Change the code so that a person and his companion are both created at the same time instead of having to put in each person's info twice.
